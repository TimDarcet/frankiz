This is an example of how a website should implement remote authentication with Frankiz.
- frankiz-login.inc.php : config & functions to interact with Frankiz
- frankiz-auth.php : run frankiz_auth_ask() which asks an user to login
- frankiz-site.php : where frankiz goes back

In the database, insert into table 'remote' the following values :
- site = your website's URI
- privkey = a secret key between you and Frankiz
- label = name of your website
- rights = what you are allowed to ask, among :
  * names : get names (HrUid = human-readable user ID, first, last, nick) of the logged user
  * email
  * rights : remote rights for some groups
  * sport
  * promo
  * photo
  * binets_admin

For example, a query with names, email, sport, promo, photo may return
something like this (in the example) :
Array
(
    [uid] => 12465
    [hruid] => nicolas.iooss
    [firstname] => Nicolas
    [lastname] => Iooss
    [nickname] => Fishilico
    [email] => nicolas.iooss@polytechnique.edu
    [sport] => Natation
    [promo] => 2010
    [photo] => https://www.frankiz.net/image/full/14417
    [location] => http://localhost/my-user-page
)
